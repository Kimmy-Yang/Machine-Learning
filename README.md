# Machine-Learning

I took CS-E4710 Machine Learning: Supervised Methods D in year 2022. After the cosre, I know how to recognize and formalize supervised machine learning problems, how to implement basic optimization algorithms for supervised learning problems, how to evaluate the performance supervised machine learning models, and has understanding of the statistical and computational limits of supervised machine learning, as well as the principles behind commonly used machine learning models. The course provides me a solide understanding of the following topics:
 
## Part I: Theory 

- Introduction
- Generalization error analysis & PAC learning
- Rademacher Complexity & VC dimension
- Model selection
## Part II: Algorithms and models 

- Linear models: perceptron, logistic regession
- Support vector machines
- Kernel methods
- Neural networks (MLPs)
- Ensemble methods

## Part III: Additional topics

- Feature learning, selection and sparsity
- Multi-class classification
- Preference learning, ranking

I uploaded part of the assignemtn code here:

Quiz 4: compare the AUC score for the three versions of the SVM solution methods ((https://github.com/Kimmy-Yang/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Quiz%204.ipynb))
Quiz 5: compare different classifers  ((https://github.com/Kimmy-Yang/Machine-Learning/blob/main/quiz%205.ipynb))
Quiz 6: implement transformation techiques for the selected features. ((https://github.com/Kimmy-Yang/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Quiz%206.ipynb))
